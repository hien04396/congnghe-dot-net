# Online Shop - ASP.NET Core Project

This is my e-commerce project built with ASP.NET Core.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- SQL Server or compatible database
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hien04396/congnghe-dot-net
cd congnghe-dot-net
```

### 2. Restore Client-Side Libraries

This project uses LibMan (Library Manager) to manage client-side libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery.

**Using Command Line**
```bash
cd OnlineShop
dotnet restore
libman restore
```

If you don't have LibMan CLI installed:
```bash
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Web.LibraryManager.Cli
```

### 3. Restore NuGet Packages

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 4. Configure Database

Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to match your database setup.

### 5. Run Database Migrations

Manually create a database name online_store, then run online_store_scheme.sql and online_store_seed.sql

### 6. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at `https://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in launchSettings.json).
